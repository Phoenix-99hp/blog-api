This is the node/Express back-end part of my blog website. 

It handles requests from two React front-end sites (blog-posts and blog-author). blog-posts is the guest site where guests can read my blog posts and leave comments, and blog-author is my personal site where I can write and publish blog posts and edit (delete) existing posts and user's comments. 

This node/Express back-end uses MongoDB as a database to store blog posts and comments. Api calls are made to the back-end from the two front-end sites to retrieve existing posts and comments. 

Check out the front-end site ("https://phoenix-99hp.github.io/blog-posts/") to see it in action!
